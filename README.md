This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Functional Requirement
- [x] Create an empty box where array value is 1.
- [x] User can select a box. Upon selection the box background color should change to #0bcc59.
- [x] Once all boxes are selected then the boxes should auto-deselect based on the order of selection.
- [x] Deselection should be non-interruptible as in once started, we can't stop it.
- [x] During de-selection, user should not be able to select a new box as in disable any box interaction.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
